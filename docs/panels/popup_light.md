## About

The light entity detail panel allows to control a single light entity.

```yaml
key: popup_light_key
type: popup_light
```

The functions available depend on the light entity being used. Only buttons for supported functions will appear.

**If the entity is not available then the popup will close automatically.**

## Config

```yaml
```
